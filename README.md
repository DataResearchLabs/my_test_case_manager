### Introduction 
My Test Case Manager is a lean tool designed for organizing test cases and managing test run results.  It is a simple, minimalist design for
software test engineers conducting functional or expoloratory testing.  Business analysts can also use it for conducting user acceptance testing (UAT).
First you write the test cases, then you execute them.  Run results are tallied and graphed on subsequent worksheets.  You use these graphs to communicate status to your project team.  Show them how test cycles work, how test cases are built up over time, how regression testing works with each new build received, how risk is managed from build test to build test, etc.
