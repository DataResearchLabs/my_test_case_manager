1. Now only allow whole numbers 0-999 to be entered.  Message added indicating this and not to enter "m".  Error occurs if data validation rule broken.  Avoids scenario as reported by Ana Paula Olvia (thank you for bug report Ana!)<br>

1. Add "Release Notes" tab to templates (not samples).  Date and version stamp each release.  Number the fixes.<br>
2. Make About screen point to YouTube PlayList, not the overall site link<br>
3. Add a link to the Basic XL YouTube PlayList to offer free training on Excel usage tips<br>
4. Re-order graph series so that Qpass is adjacent to Pass in all Test Case count and trend graphs (at least one is wrong)<br>
5. Defect trend graph Open has border turned on for red (should be fill only) check all<br>
6. Releasability Graph allows for 0.5 in the count when count is low (integer only).  Check all graphsâ€¦confirmed most are wrong, especially when no data.  Fix all by setting minimum graph unit to 1, while leaving max to Auto.<br>
