<ins>**v5.01.44308  -  2021.04.22**</ins><br>
1. DEFECT - Now only allow whole numbers 0-999 to be entered.  Message added indicating this and not to enter "m".<br>
   Error occurs if data validation rule broken.  Avoids scenario as reported by Ana Paula Olvia (thank you for bug report Ana!)<br>
<br>


<ins>**v5.01.44299  -  2021.04.13**</ins><br>
1. CHANGE - Add "Release Notes" tab to templates (not samples).  Date and version stamp each release.  Number the fixes.<br>
2. CHANGE - Make About screen point to YouTube PlayList, not the overall site link<br>
3. CHANGE - Add a link to the Basic XL YouTube PlayList to offer free training on Excel usage tips<br>
4. DEFECT - Re-order graph series so that Qpass is adjacent to Pass in all Test Case count and trend graphs (at least one is wrong)<br>
5. DEFECT - Defect trend graph Open has border turned on for red (should be fill only) check all<br>
6. DEFECT - Releasability Graph allows for 0.5 in the count when count is low (integer only).  Check all graphsâ€¦confirmed most are wrong, especially when no data.  Fix all by setting minimum graph unit to 1, while leaving max to Auto.<br>
